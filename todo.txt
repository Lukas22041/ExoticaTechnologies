drop more exotics from IBB and HVB fleets
melt chips into parts that can be used to upgrade bandwidth
scrapping boss ships for unique one of a kind exotics
* ziggurat - mote storm around ship

consider: System cooldown for weapon range?
consider: Magazine reload for fire rate


done:

general:
- attempted improvement to crate code to fix instances of it not pulling chips into itself
- improved chip rendering code and icons
exotics:
- added TWO exotics, one exclusive to the path
- tier 3b drive now stacks
- missile forge now reduces damage but enables you to spam missiles, and reloads weapons individually
- added combat activators for salvo, feeder, and drive flux vent exotics
- hangar forge -> phased fighter tether
- daemon core now correctly applies bandwidth from types, and does not drop as salvage. you must use archdaemon cores to install this now.
- alpha subcore has salvage chance reduced by 75%. you will probably have to use alpha cores to install this now.
- exotics generate more commonly on larger ship sizes
- exotics generate less on civilian ships
- pure type now scales on base bandwidth used and exotics used
- improved type overlay icons to be more visible
upgrades:
- added FOUR upgrades
- buffed assault wings, forced overtime, infernal engines, welded armor, commissioned crews
- nerfed advanced flux coils and derelict weapons assistant by giving them drawbacks that don't really hurt either faction's ships much
- nerfed hel engines by increasing bandwidth slightly (this will probably result in some existing ships going over their bandwidth cap. good for you!)
- rebalanced overcharged shields by shifting more into promoting active shield play by increasing unfold rate further, and both flux/s and flux/dam stats are increased
- fixed a bunch of upgrade drawbacks not starting at level 3
- reduced salvage chance of faction-specific upgrades to 10% (from 450%) (if you change this you have weak bones)
- reduced salvage change of high-level upgrades by up to 75%
- upgrades generate more commonly on larger ship sizes
- added upgrade level to icon
