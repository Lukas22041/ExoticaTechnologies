drop more exotics from IBB and HVB fleets
melt chips into parts that can be used to upgrade bandwidth
scrapping boss ships for unique one of a kind exotics
* ziggurat - mote storm around ship

consider: System cooldown for weapon range?
consider: Magazine reload for fire rate

todo: update interface to use new buttonPressed methods
todo: add Advanced Gunnery Control tags to things that deserve them (like missile spam for hacked missile forge)

done:
- fixed crate disappearing when you open it (sorry)
-- crates now share a global inventory
- added filters to upgrade and exotic UI
- added new upgrade Oversized Magazines
- fixed OCD in ship mod panel
- fixed debris field generation and scanning again
- fixed newer exotics not dropping from salvage loot (like research stations)
- fixed exotic types not appearing in salvage loot
- added upgrades to salvage loot. total value of exotica drops has increased to offset this
- nerfed terminator subsystems
-- range reduced by 33% (this means it is 66% of the original ship system's range)
-- drone recharge time increased from 20 seconds to 30 seconds
-- also tri tachyon will use them less now lol

hotfix:
- fixed exploration crash (upgrades were being generated with level 0)
- fixed fleet UI being broken
- fixed scanner UI not displaying exotics correctly with high UI scaling
