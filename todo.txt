drop more exotics from IBB and HVB fleets
melt chips into parts that can be used to upgrade bandwidth
scrapping boss ships for unique one of a kind exotics
* ziggurat - mote storm around ship

consider: System cooldown for weapon range?
consider: Magazine reload for fire rate

todo: update interface to use new buttonPressed methods
todo: add Advanced Gunnery Control tags to things that deserve them (like missile spam for hacked missile forge)

done:
- buffed exotic and upgrade drop rates from enemy fleets
- fixed drive flux vent AI activation, and it now has reduced cooldown (15s to 10s)
- updated terminator subsystems AI to use drones more frequently if it has more
- fixed drone stuff applying to modules
- fixed pain from dropping as part of certain ships (it is now removed after battle)
- noticed that pure type exotics were the most used ones:
-- corrupted type exotics positive mult increased (150% to 200%), and negative mult (150% to 175%)
-- guerilla type exotics positive mult increased (175% to 200%). note that it still scales with fleet size
- blocked alpha subcore from having any effect if the SHU Armament Support System is installed
-- additionally prevented alpha subcore from being installed if the SHU Armament Support System is installed
- multiple UI level improvements
-- upgrades and exotics now display both description and effects at once
-- overview tab is now the main source to view all upgrades/exotics that your ship has at once
-- removed hullmod expanding info

for selkie:

-- fires dumb-flare cone on parent ship vent
- afterburner
-- high speed
-- low turn rate
-- 120% engine/glow length
