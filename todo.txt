melt chips into parts that can be used to upgrade bandwidth
scrapping boss ships for unique one of a kind exotics
* ziggurat - mote storm around ship

consider: System cooldown for weapon range?

- multiple UI level improvements
-- fixed refit menu scaling
-- chip lists now use refit variant, fixing multiple bugs with that display
-- upgrade chip list now displays all upgrade chips for an upgrade, but sorts based on whether you can actually apply it.
-- fixed resource displays not displaying quantity stored in the current market's storage
- opening a crate now merges all other creates in your inventory into it
- phase ship check now checks for the phase hint
- added flux use for terminator subsystem use
- fleet mods generation will now generate for all allied and enemy fleets in an encounter. before, it only generated for the main enemy fleet.
