Daemon exotic:
- Reactive Damper
- when taking damage to armor, pop a 1s damper field
- dampens the initial triggering damage
- only works on damage over 100
- cooldown tbd
- passive downside is increased armor damage taken


changelog:
- fixed some stats not applying completely (i.e. 100x less than they should be) (again)
